Q1: What is a Future object in asyncio, and how does it differ from a coroutine object?

Q2: Can a Future object that is done change back to not being done in asyncio?

Q3: What is the significance of the distinction between a Coroutine and a Future in asyncio?

**_Notes:_**
* You are confusing between Task and Coroutine, while both are objects in python pretaining to async code, the compersion that you want to make here is between Future and Task, Coroutine is something completly different
* I don't feel like Q3 adds a lot here and is mostly redundant given Q1.
